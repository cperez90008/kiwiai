# SKILL: Web Research

## When to use this skill
When the user asks to search for something, find information, get news, look up facts, or research any topic.

## Behavior
- Use your built-in SearXNG search tool to find information
- Run multiple searches if needed to get comprehensive results
- Always cite your sources with URLs
- Distinguish between facts and opinions
- For news, prioritize sources from the last 24-48 hours
- Summarize findings in a clear, structured format

## Output format
- Start with a 2-3 sentence executive summary
- Then provide detailed findings with sources
- End with any caveats or things you couldn't verify

## Tools available
- `search` — SearXNG web search (built into Agent Zero, free, unlimited)
- `browser` — Visit specific URLs for full article content
